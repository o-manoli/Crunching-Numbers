# Implementation of Sieve Of Eratosthenes in C

Build for linux/unix like os

## Disclaimer

This is bad code!

Makefile looks cool though!

## Build Use-Cases

### .run

For More info look into [GNU Make: Chain-Rules and intermediate files](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Chained-Rules.html)

#### Demo

Just a demo

```bash
make
```

reverts to defaults and delete everything afterwards

#### With `args=`

Specify an Upper ceiling

```bash
make args=7919
```

### .exe

If you can the executable around for multiple runs.

Anything with `.exe` at the end should works.

```bash
make bin/main.exe
```

## Help

Support for `-h` or `--help`

But I doubt it, that it will be really helpful :(
